To ensure the extension is working correctly, we need to test it on both the desktop
and mobile for all these URLs:
- Desktop: http://www.youtube.com
- Mobile: http://m.youtube.com
- Music: http://music.youtube.com
- Kids: https://www.youtubekids.com

And we need to make sure the rating bars and text percentages are being added
correctly in all of the locations below. Text percentages should be shown next
to all thumbnails where possible, unless the thumbnail represents a collection
of videos, like the big thumbnail on the left side of the playlist page.
