Known issues:

On YouTube Gaming playlist pages, the big icon link at the top doesn't show a
rating bar. This is due to complications in finding the video ID associated
with the thumbnail, and since the ratings for the videos are shown in the
thumbnails listed just below it, it doesn't add much value to also show the
rating for the first video again in the top big thumbnail.
